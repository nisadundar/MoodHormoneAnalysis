# MoodHormoneAnalysis
**MoodHormoneAnalysis** is a data analysis project that investigates the relationship between human hormone levels and mood. This project explores the intersection of neuroscience and data science by analyzing hormones like dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins, focusing on their potential effects on mood.
Using data science techniques, we examine correlations between hormone levels and their impact on mood scores through detailed data visualization and analysis.
## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of sample hormone levels and mood measurements, accessible from **data/hormone_data.csv**. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Date**: Date of measurement
- **Dopamine**: Dopamine levels
- **Serotonin**: Serotonin levels
- **Oxytocin**: Oxytocin levels
- **Endorphin**: Endorphin levels
- **Mood**: Mood score
- ## Technologies Used

This project uses the following libraries and tools:

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data processing and analysis
- **NumPy**: Mathematical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Working environment
- This analysis suggests potential effects of certain hormone levels on mood. For instance, variations in dopamine and serotonin levels may influence mood scores. These findings provide a foundation for further investigation.
